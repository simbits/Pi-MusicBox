    	    </ul>
        </p>

        <h3> Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Download the Beta3 image. It's around 190MB in (compressed) size; 1GB uncompressed.
                <ul  style="font-size: 120%">
                    <li><a href="http://dl.mopidy.com/pimusicbox/musicbox0.3b3.zip">Fast mirror</a>
                    <li><a href="musicbox0.3b3.zip">This site</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract the zip-file. Put the resulting image on your SD Card by following <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Easy_way">these
                instuctions</a>. The image is for a 1GB card, but you can put it on a
                larger one. 
            </li>
<!--            <li>
                If you're on Windows, download an editor which supports Unix editing (not the default Notepad!).
                E.g. <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a>
                or <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
                . Users of OSX and Linux can edit the file directly.
                <br />
            </li>
            -->
            <li>
                Open the contents of the 'config' folder of SD Card in your
                Finder/Explorer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add your credentials of your Spotify Premium account, Last FM, Wifi, etc to the file
                <code>
                    settings.ini
                </code>
                .
            </li>
            <li>
        	MusicBox will autodetect usb audiocards/speakers/boxes and hdmi. 
        	It's possible to override this in the ini-file. For example if you want to use analog out while having hdmi connected.
            <li>
                There is also an option to let MusicBox scan the contents of music files you upload to the device.
                This folder is accessible via Windows 
                networking. If you put music files in there, and let MusicBox scan the files (only needed when the music files are updated!)
                , Mopidy will find them. Scanning can take some time though!<br/>
		One small problem: you have to resize the filesystem on the SD-Card to put more files there.
                Login (ssh or local) and issue the command raspi-config. This program has an option to resize
                it automatically. A future version of MusicBox will do this on first boot.
                btw: the webclient doesn't support playing these files yet, but MPD-clients do. <br/>
	    </li>
	    <li>You can also mount a Windows Network Share. The files on this share will be scanned too.
                The webclient doesn't support playing these files yet, but MPD-clients do. Scanning can take some time though!<br/>
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the card in the Pi
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Connect cables (You don't have to connect a monitor to the Pi if you
                don't want to)
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn on Pi
            </li>
            <li>
                Wait for a while
            </li>
            <li>
                Point your browser to the Pi. Depending on your network and computers,
                it will be available at this address:
                <code>
                    <a href="http://musicbox.local/">http://musicbox.local/</a>
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Most OS X/iOS and Windows devices probably will find it immediately. If it doesn't work, you could try to
                install Apple Bonjour/iTunes in Windows to make it work. Linux should also work (if Avahi or Samba/Winbind is installed).
            </li>
            <li>
                Using Android, you have to point your browser to the MusicBox using the IP-address of your Pi, e.g. <code>http://192.168.1.5/</code> .
                 There is no way to change that for now, unless Android would support it,
                The IP-address is printed on the screen when
                MusicBox is started. Connect a monitor/tv to find out.
            </li>
            <li>
                To use Wifi and USB-Audio you have to plugin the devices before you
                start the Pi. Restart if you plug them in later.
            </li>

        <h3 style="color: red"> SECURITY WARNING</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            This is system not secure at all. Don't run it outside a firewall!! When I find the time, I will fix it.
            <br />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Mopidy musicserver is not protected, and the Musicbox services are
                run as root. Maybe this is better in the future, but not now. Sorry.
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Also, the passwords of Spotify and wifi are stored in plain text on
                the SD card. 
            </li>
            <li>
                You can SSH to the server with the <strong>root</strong> login and
                the password <strong>musicbox</strong>.
