        <h2>Pi MusicBox</h2>
        <p>
            Operate Spotify from your couch using a browser with this <em>ready to eat</em> software for the Raspberry Pi.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A lot of people have problems getting the Pi to work as a remote Spotify-player. This bootable image makes it a lot
            easier. As a bonus, it includes AirTunes support.
        </p>

        <h3> Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Working Spotify server based on Mopidy
            </li>
            <li>
                Remote control it with a nice browser-interface (webserver included!), or with an MPD-client
            </li>
            <li>
                AirTunes streaming
            </li>
            <li>
                No need for tinkering, no need to use the Linux
                commandline
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                USB Audio support (supporting all kinds of USB soundcards, speakers, headphones).
            </li>
            <li>
                The analog port works, but the sound quality is not great. Flat so to say. This is a hardware problem (to get the Pi as cheap as it is, they had to use cheap hardware to produce sound).
                An external USB soundcard is recommended for better sound quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wifi support (WPA, if the Pi-kernel supports your wifi-adapter)
            </li>
            <li>
                This image is also a great way to get started with tinkering for other ways of using the Pi as a Music playing device, because it solves a lot of problems.
                (Mopidy can e.g. be modified to play local music-files, but it's not enabled at the moment.)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Requirements </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Working Raspberry Pi 
            </li>
            <li>
                Speakers/amplifier (analog or USB)
            </li>
            <li>
                SD Card, 2GB minimum (tested on a 4GB model. It can probably run on a
                1GB, but then you need to resize the partitions)
            </li>
            <li>
                Computer with a modern browser; tablet or phone. The webinterface is tested with
                recent versions of Firefox, Chrome and iOS (iPad/iPhone), modern versions of Android (Chrome Mobile, Firefox Mobile). 
                Internet Explorer version 10 works with the webinterface, earlier versions don't. You can also use an 
                <a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients">MPD client</a> to connect.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spotify Premium account for streaming.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Beta</h3>
        <p>
            Please regard this image as beta-quality. It's quite stable, but
            don't cry if things go wrong...
            <ul>
                <li>
                    v0.2.2: Windows finds the musicbox.local address by itself now (samba).
                </li>
                <li>
                    v0.2.1: Removed ugly sounds on analog port when changing tracks (pulseaudio). An USB-soundcard is still recommended.
                </li>
                <li>
                    v0.2: New, much nicer web-interface (Jquery Mobile).
                </li>
                <li>
                    v0.2: Based on Raspbian (Moebius) for better performance and stability
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3> Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A newer Beta version is available <a href="beta.html">here</a>. 
                It's much faster, better, easy to use, smaller, etc, but it could still contain one or two bugs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Download the image. It's around 800MB in (compressed) size; 2GB uncompressed.
                <ul  style="font-size: 120%">
                    <li><a href="http://dl.mopidy.com/pimusicbox/musicbox0.2.2.zip">Fast mirror</a>
                    <li><a href="musicbox0.2.2.zip">This site (slower)</a>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract the zip-file. Put the resulting image on your SD Card by following <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Easy_way">these
                instuctions</a>. The image is for a 2GB card, but you can put it on a
                larger one. It could even fit on a 1GB card, but that needs some work.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're on Windows, download an editor which supports Unix editing (not the default Notepad!).
                E.g. <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a>
                or <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
                . Users of OSX and Linux can edit the file directly.
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Open the contents of the 'config' folder of SD Card in your
                Finder/Explorer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using the editor, add your credentials of your Spotify Premium account to the file
                <code>
                    settings.py
                </code>
                .
            </li>
            <li>
                Optional (if you have a Wifi-adapter): edit
                <code>
                    wpa.conf
                </code>
                for your Wifi
                credentials if you want Wifi (WPA/WPA2 security)
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the card in the Pi
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Connect cables (You don't have to connect a monitor to the Pi if you
                don't want to)
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn on Pi
            </li>
            <li>
                Wait for a while
            </li>
            <li>
                Point your browser to the Pi. Depending on your network and computers,
                it will be available at this address:
                <code>
                    http://musicbox.local/
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Most OS X/iOS and Windows devices probably will find it immediately. If it doesn't work, you could try to
                install Apple Bonjour/iTunes in Windows to make it work. Linux should also work (if Avahi or Samba/Winbind is installed).
            </li>
            <li>
                Using Android, you have to point your browser to the MusicBox using the IP-address of your Pi, e.g. <code>http://192.168.1.5/</code> .
                 There is no way to change that for now, unless Android would support it,
                The IP-address is printed on the screen when
                MusicBox is started. Connect a monitor/tv to find out.
            </li>
            <li>
                To use Wifi and USB-Audio you have to plugin the devices before you
                start the Pi. Restart if you plug them in later.
            </li>

        <h3 style="color: red"> SECURITY WARNING</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            This is system not secure at all. Don't run it outside a firewall!! When I find the time, I will fix it.
            <br />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Mopidy musicserver is not protected, and the Musicbox services are
                run as root. Maybe this is better in the future, but not now. Sorry.
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Also, the passwords of Spotify and wifi are stored in plain text on
                the SD card. 
            </li>
            <li>
                You can SSH to the server with the <strong>root</strong> login and
                the password <strong>musicbox</strong>.
